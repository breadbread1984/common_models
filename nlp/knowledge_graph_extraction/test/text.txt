Alice is a software engineer from New York who used to work at Google. Her friend Bob is from San Francisco, who used to work at Facebook and now works at a startup. Alice and Bob attended the AI conference held in San Francisco last year together, where they met Carol from Microsoft. Alice and Bob are both very interested in the field of artificial intelligence, and they often discuss the latest research progress together on weekends. Alice is currently working on natural language processing technology, and she often communicates with Carol to discuss how to improve the performance of the model. Bob is particularly interested in machine learning algorithms, and he recently joined a startup to develop a new recommendation system. Alice and Bob plan to meet again at the NLP conference next month, where they hope to see Carol and discuss the latest technology trends. Alice and Bob are both NYU alumni, and they knew each other in college. Alice received a computer science scholarship during college, and Bob was an active member of the computer science club. They both entered the technology industry after graduation, but chose different companies. During her time at Google, Alice participated in several important projects, including the development of new search algorithms. While working at Facebook, Bob was responsible for improving the social network's recommendation system. Both Alice and Bob have achieved significant success in their respective companies and have had very successful careers.

Alice and Bob have always maintained close contact and often communicate through email and social media. Alice is currently working on a project on sentiment analysis and she hopes Bob can provide some advice on recommendation systems. Bob is studying how to use deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of recommendation systems. They plan to present their research results at the AI conference next month and discuss how to apply these technologies to real projects.

Alice and Bob also plan to visit technology companies in San Francisco, including Google and Facebook, during the conference. They hope to communicate with engineers from these companies and learn about the latest technology trends. Alice and Bob both believe that attending such conferences is a very important part of their careers, and they hope to meet more peers through these conferences and share their research results.

Alice and Bob are both looking forward to future cooperation and hope to work together on future projects. They believe that through cooperation, they can develop more advanced technologies and make greater contributions to the technology industry.
